1. Flutter 的视图刷新，每次都是从头绘制的，没有diff draw，它认为自己非常有效效率，即使每一帧都需要变化，也都全部重头开始绘制。参考：https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/declarative

> Many assumptions that you might have don’t apply to Flutter. For example, in Flutter it’s okay to rebuild parts of your UI from scratch instead of modifying it. Flutter is fast enough to do that, even on every frame if needed.
